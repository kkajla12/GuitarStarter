This means guitar straps, strings, cables, and many more items which are often overlooked because of their background role in guitar playing. This guide will describe the items every guitarist absolutely needs and recommend the best ones to buy for performance and durability.</p>

                    <dt>Guitar strings</dt>
                    <dd>Guitar strings are essential in the comfort and overall playability of a guitar. Since strings come in different gauge ranges and material, they can make a guitar easier to play with a lighter gauge of strings or harder to play with a heavier gauge of strings (this difference is noticeable but usually relative to the guitarist). Strings also play a role in the sound of a guitar. Thicker strings can result in a heavier sound and vice-versa, nickel strings can result in clearer note production, and steel strings can reduce the sliding noise of your fingers going up and down the fretboard to hit different notes. However, at the end of the day, the strings which are most comfortable and whose sound you like the most should be the strings that you choose to buy.</dd>

                    <dt>Guitar straps</dt>
                    <dd>A guitar strap is essential if you ever want to play your guitar on stage, or while standing up at all. Picking a guitar strap is more about function than anything else. There is no need to be picky unless you want a strap with a specific design. Other than that, pick a strap which holds the guitar up consistently in a stable way so the guitar doesn't lean to either side. Also make sure the strap is comfortable for you as may be spending a considerable amount of time with it around your shoulder.</dd>

                    <dt>Lots and lots of picks</dt>
                    <dd>Guitar picks are not a huge matter, but they can definitely add comfort and sometimes performance improvements for a guitarist. Nevertheless, it is best to keep a well stocked supply of your favorite picks so you always have at least a few to use. Moreover, certain guitar picks may be more durable for one guitarist than the other. The most important aspect of a guitar pick is the thickness (gauge) which is an attribute measured in millimeters (mm).
                      <ul>
                        <li><strong>Extra Light</strong> picks are of the thinnest gauge (&le; 0.44mm) so are very thin and flexible. These picks are suited for softer styles of playing which do not put a lot of stress on the pick which might cause it to snap.</li><br>
                        <li><strong>Light</strong> picks are the next thinnest gauge (between 0.45-0.69mm) so are they are slightly more sturdy than and can handle a little more stress. These picks are still suited for lighter playing styles, but may be more comfortable for those guitarist who prefer less flexible of the pick when strumming.</li><br>
                        <li><strong>Medium</strong> picks are the gauge (between 0.70-0.84mm) used by most guitarists because they are somewhere in the middle and provide some flexibility while still giving the controlled feeling of a thicker and sturdy pick. Medium gauge picks are suitable for any playing style so are the best bet for a beginner.</li><br>
                        <li><strong>Heavy</strong> picks are a thicker than medium gauge picks (between 0.85-1.20mm) to provide a more powerful picking attack which can be useful for adding attitude to notes in a rock solo or adding anger and power to heavy metal riffs. These picks are also the option for players who have a strong picking attack which results in breaking medium gauge picks.</li><br>
                        <li><strong>Extra Heavy</strong> picks are the thickest gauge (&ge; 1.50mm) and can handle a lot of abuse! These picks are typically for guitarists who have a very strong/hard picking attack and are prone to breaking lighter medium or heavy gauge picks.</li>

                  <dl>
                    <dt>Several durable amp cables</dt>
                    <dd>Once you've got an amp that you like and you start buying effects pedals, amp cables will seem scarce. Make sure you have enough cables to connect your guitar, amps, and any/all effects you would like to use at once so that you can put all of these great musical pieces to work. It is important to buy dependable and durable cables because loosing even one cable to wear and tear can prevent you from playing on your desired sound setup. A good cable should all carry sound clearly from the guitar to the amplifier and should be able to handle plenty of wear and tear while maintaining this performance. This is one of the few items for which it is worth paying a higher price tag to ensure that you get a reliable cable.</dd>

                  <dl>
                    <dt>Guitar bags and hardshell cases (if you like those crazy body shapes)</dt>
                    <dd>Make sure you have a guitar gig back if you plan on taking your guitar anywhere outside of your house! It may seem unlikely, but small dings can happen even when handling a guitar as carefully as possible, and if you want your guitar in pristine condition for as long as you own it, it is best to get a bag or case for it. Hardshell cases are like large briefcases and provide better protection for a guitar. They are typically made for guitars with extreme body styles (think explorer, flying-v, kelly, etc.) which don't fit well in gig bags, or for very expensive guitars which are better kept in hardshell cases. Usually a gig bag will do unless you have a guitar with an extreme body shape or if you want to be extra cautious.</dd>
